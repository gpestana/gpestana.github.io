<p>Services based on P2P and decentralized networks are reaching mass adoption
(e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS, Dat). People are calling this new wave of
distributed and decentralized systems the Web 3.0. Many of these services and
networks rely heavily on Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) - e.g. IPFS, bittorrent - or use
it as an important building block (e.g. Ethereum). It is expected that DHTs will
be an important building block for many networks and services for the Web 3.0.</p>

<p>Distributed hash tables are powerful protocols that enable content discovering
and routing in P2P networks. In &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; DHT implementations (e.g. Kademlia,
Chord),
peer interactions leak a lot of information about who is in the network, who
stores what files and who are the producers and consumers of content. This gives
potential attackers a good picture of the network with fewer resources and hinders
anonymous and private interactions over P2P DHT overlay networks.</p>

<p>Some of the desirable properties of a private and metadata resistant DHT are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anonymity for producers of content</strong>: tracking down who was the originator of
content stored in the DHT should not be possible.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Anonymity for consumers of content</strong>: nodes that request content from the DHT
should not be linked to the requested content by external actors.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Plausible deniability of the files hosted in the network nodes</strong>: when peers query
for content in the DHT, they should not be able to identify which peers are
storing the content.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The information leaked by DHTs can be used to target and censor
individuals, communities and services. Private, anonymous and metadata resistant
systems are important for ensuring that our privacy is protected against
attackers. Thus, given the importance DHTs will have in future services and
networks, it is important to research and develop protocols and primitives
that keep DHT users anonymous.</p>
