The ethos of the P2P community and the decentralized web is based
on a new paradigm where people and communities can interoperate and collaborate
without the need for external stewardship. This new paradigm opens doors for
user self-sovereignty, personal data ownership and freedom from central
authorities which incentives tend to lock-in their users and to hold and
monetize private data in order to maximize their profits. However, P2P and
decentralized protocols are complex and collaboration between multiple parties
often leaks metadata that can be used to target individuals and communities.
While centralized systems disclose user's behaviour and social graph to one
centralized entity, naive decentralized systems potentially disclose that
information to everyone in the network. While it is clear that current systems
are not focusing on user privacy, failing to deliver it will render
decentralized systems unusable and unattractive for mass adoption or as a viable
alternative to centralized systems.
