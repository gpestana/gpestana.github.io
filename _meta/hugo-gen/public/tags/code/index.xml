      <description>This post discusses ideas for a proof of concept for a unit test framework for Kapacitor&amp;rsquo;s TICKscripts and alerts. If you are not familiar with Kapacitor and the TICK script I really suggest you to go ahead and check InfluxData&amp;rsquo;s website and learn more about it! In short, the TICK stack is a time series data platform that allows you to easily store, analyse and act on time series data at scale.</description>

      <description>In one of my side-project - which uses socket.io - I need to reach a consensus amongst users in the same room. Initial requirements:
 The definition of &amp;lsquo;consensus&amp;rsquo; should be flexible and interchangeable in run-time; The time to reach the consensus should be tracked; The final consensus amongst the clients could possibly output some data that the server may need to use further on;  My solution consists of a modular entity which I pompously called consensus manager.</description>
