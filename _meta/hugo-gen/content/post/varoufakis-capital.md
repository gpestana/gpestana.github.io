I cherish the moments when I come across people who are well spoken and can get their mental model of the world across with clarity. These people often push me to think deeply about their views of the world. Recently I've listened to a [podcast episode hosted by Russel Brand](https://www.russellbrand.com/podcast/ep-49-yanis-varoufakis-euro-power-man-knows/#main), where Yanis Varoufakis was the guest. They discussed about the state of Europe, the times of Varoufakis as Greek finance minister, the degeneration of capitalism and its institutions, how commodification and alienation of our society and values are turning us into miserable people, detached from humanity and raw material for keeping the current system of capital accumulation by the few alive. There was a particular though that resonated so much with my view of the world that I started reading [Capital by Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital), the minute after I stopped thinking about what I've heard. I transcribe it here:

"You know what, this is why I'm still a Marxist in my late 50s. Because Marx describe beautifully the epic drama of capitalism. Where you've got machines that enhance productivity magnificently. Instead of the machines becoming our slaves, we become heir slaves. And that includes the capitalists who own the machines. This remarkable text, in which Marx poetically explains the meaning of the drama of the capitalist. The capitalist who knows how terrible the life of the workers are and his so desperately keen not to become of them that is losing his humanity by squeezing the living day lights out of them, in order to make sure he is not undercut by his competitors and become one of them. And in the end, the workers become alienates, working before the machines in the production line and the capitalists are there to serve the interest of capital accumulation without themselves ever being capable of achieving happiness and satisfaction, joy. Marxist critique of capitalism is not one that is unfair or unequal. No. It's one where every member of humanity is condemn to a sub-standard (?) life, including the capitalists."


Varoufakis also makes an interesting point about the current "system" and its organic self perpetuation, or the "conspiracy without conspirators" The way I interpreted it is that those in a position of power make decisions that improve their personal success - individually aiming at a local maxima. But as an whole, all of them reinforce a capitalist system that exploits people ruthlessly in order to accumulate capital, many even without realizing that they are part of it. After all, all they've done was to maximize a local maxima. This "system" is beyond their control and reinforces itself organically even without making any explicit efforts towards the end tragedy.

There are many other interesting bits in the episode, [you can check the rest yourself](https://www.russellbrand.com/podcast/ep-49-yanis-varoufakis-euro-power-man-knows/#main).
