The goal of Coin Flipping Request Delegation (CFRD) is to add plausible
deniability of routing and lookup requests in P2P networks, with special
emphasis on DHT networks. The CFRD lookup protocol works by probabilistically
creating a new lookup from a received routing request.

### CFRD in Kademlia DHT 

In a Kademlia lookup request (as defined by these
[specs](http://xlattice.sourceforge.net/components/protocol/kademlia/specs.html)),
the lookup initiator creates an ordered shortlist containing `k` peers closest
to the ID of the contentID requested. The shortlist is ordered by proximity and
is first populated with peers in the initiator's bucket list. Each iteration of
the protocol consists of selecting `Î±` of the closest peers to the contentID in
the shortlist and issue in parallel a `FIND_VALUE` request to them. The
responses contain a set of the closest peers of each of the peers which that
received the `FIND_VALUE` request. This information is added to the shortlist in
a way that it maintains its order (i.e. first peers are closer to the
contentID). This protocol proceeds until 1) a peer responds with `STORE` message
(value found); 2) an iteration in which no new peer is added to the shortlist
(value not found) and; 3) lookup timeout.

The CFRD construction transforms `FIND_VALUE` requests into new `FIND_VALUE`
requests in a probabilistic way. When a peer receives a `FIND_VALUE` request, it
will flip a coin to decide whether to respond to the request or instead start a
lookup request itself. Once the lookup is resolved by the new peer (which is not
the original initiator), it will cache the content and reply to the peer which
initially asked for the content with a `STORE` message.

This mechanism adds plausible deniability to DHT lookups, since (privacy)
adversaries monitoring network requests (locally and to a certain threshold)
will not be able to distinguish between original content lookups from lookups
that were initiated because of the CFRD mechanism. This mechanism aims at
decoupling peer behaviour (network request) from user behaviour (interests and
personal behaviour).
