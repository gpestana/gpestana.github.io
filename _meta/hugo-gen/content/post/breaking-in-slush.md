SLUSH [1](https://slush.org) is the "biggest entrepreneurship event in the
(European) 
nordics", where around 20.000 attendees flocked in Helsinki early December to
talk about startups (I think..). I've had the priviledge of attending
when there were less than 200 people in the venue, just a few years ago. Just as
any of its beloved startups, SLUSH has felt the need to grow. And  grow fast.
Apart from the main event in Helsinki, there are also events in Tokyo, Shangai
and Singapore with a together-participation of around 10.000 people. A pretty
big venture nowadays. I feel that SLUSH is a great picture of how the startup ecosystem 
has developed in Helsinki and Europe in general in the past 5-6 years: from a
underground scene full of garage-lovers hackers and somewhat visionares looking up
at silicion valley as the epytome of entreprenurial adventurers and $$$ to a
mainstream scene where corporations and sellers of snake oil with no content
whatsoever flock to pitch their pseudo-innovative ideas and where everyone feel
the urge to get inspired from talks about how we all can - and must - change the
world around us. From underground to overhyped. Because of all this,  I've 
refrained myself from attending anymore SLUSH
conference since last year (I still go to the parties, though, those are always
fun). 


### The challenge

At lunch time, when browsing through my Twitter, I couldn't help but to notice
 the sheer amount of tweets about SLUSH, as expected. Skimming through the #SLUSH17 
tweets, this particular one caught my eye:

This tweet had a tone of a challenge and it sparked in me a restless need to 
break in the conference without a badge. Even before I finished the lunch
sandwich, I was already sketchign a plan for getting in the venue for free.

### The plan

When short of any other idea, trying to enter in a building without permission
disguised as a construction or repairing worker is often the most obvious
option. While the famous HiVi reflective vests are meant to make whoever is
wearing them as noticeable as possible, it does the exact opposite. Just as
Harry Potter's cloak of invisibility, the HiVi reflective vest can make you
invisible to security personnel, crew members and pretty much anyone who'd be
willing to kick my ticketless ass out of the venue.

*My invisibility cloak*

After I decided to go with this plan, I headed to the closest tools
shop to buy a reflective vest. I was working before have been challenged for
the break in, so I was carrying a backpack with me. Usually conference support
personnel does not carry backpacks around, so I decided to buy a couple of large
card boxes to hide the backpack. The card boxes would also help to the disguise
and make me look like I was up for something, or so I thought.

### The recon

Once in the metro and heading to the venue, I digged into #SLUSH17 hashtag on
twitter and the official website for pictures and other information that could
somehow help me to accomplish my mission. This recon stage minted some
interesting information about the venue and more disguise props that would help
me during the break-in. 

First, I came accross this tweet where I noticed props that would help my
disguise. Getting the official SLUSH tape and wrap kmy boxes with it would give
more credebility to my desguise and send the correct cues to the crew and
security guards when I would pass the doors at a rushing pace.

I also came across a couple of tweets showing how the entrances looked like and
where the security guards were checking the badge and wristband. Mamny tweets 
also cued me of the existence of a cool room for volunteers with
restricted access inside the venue full of kids chilling out and playing
playstation.

After skimming through many #SLUSH17 tweets, I took a look at the main webpage
to gather information about the stages, keynotes scheduled for the
afternoon and some partnership companies. From this information, I decided that
in case someone ask me what am I up to, I'll be delivering two boxes to the
Fireside stage from "". Oh, and it is urgent, since the boxes should be there "
before the ending of "" talk by "".
