SLUSH [1](https://slush.org) is the "biggest entrepreneurship event in the
(European) 
nordics", where around 20.000 attendees flocked in Helsinki early December to
talk about startups (I think..). I've had the priviledge of attending
when there were less than 200 people in the venue, just a few years ago. Just as
any of its beloved startups, SLUSH has felt the need to grow. And  grow fast.
Apart from the main event in Helsinki, there are also events in Tokyo, Shangai
and Singapore with a together-participation of around 10.000 people. A pretty
big venture nowadays. I feel that SLUSH is a great picture of how the startup ecosystem 
has developed in Helsinki and Europe in general in the past 5-6 years: from a
underground scene full of garage-lovers hackers and somewhat visionares looking up
at silicion valley as the epytome of entreprenurial adventurers and $$$ to a
mainstream scene where corporations and sellers of snake oil with no content
whatsoever flock to pitch their pseudo-innovative ideas and where everyone feel
the urge to get inspired from talks about how we all can - and must - change the
world around us. From underground to overhyped. Because of all this,  I've 
refrained myself from attending anymore SLUSH
conference since last year (I still go to the parties, though, those are always
fun). 

At lunch time, when browsing through my Twitter, I couldn't help but to notice
 the sheer amount of tweets about SLUSH, as expected. Skimming through the #SLUSH17 
tweets, this particular one caught my eye:

- short notes about what slush is (people, startups, et..)
- how I went about deciding to break-in (twitter pic of Matti)
- the preps:
	- thinking of how to put it up
	- clas ohlson purchases
	- metro recon (twitter and convo on website)
	- recon onsite

- the break-in
	- first level bitter-sweet access
	- second level recon (lots of guards, all doors closes, no badged/wristbands)
	- one door to rule them all with fierce check up

- pivoting the plan
	- more recon on adjacent infra
	- another meetup and requirements to get it
	- an ilumiating idea
	- easy peasy

- once in
	- get a coffee
	- realize there are more corps then startups
	- the pic & leave

- wrap up
	- 2:30h and 8euros to break in (vs 500 euros tickets)
	- not hard at all. fun!
	- the Messukeskus vulnerability
