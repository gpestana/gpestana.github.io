# the world is eating software

I'm a senior software engineer currently working at [New Things Co](https://newthings.co).

On a daily basis, I delve into all things microservices, Node.js, Golang, AWS, docker, DCOS, Elasticsearch, React and security. Never without a warm mug of coffee by my side.

I've been working in the industry for 6+ years, playing around with Golang, Node.js, Python, data analysis, devops and web stuff. Along the way I've collaborated with some cool companies like [F-Secure](https://f-secure.com), [CERN](https://home.cern/), [Fivestars](http://www.fivestars.com/), [Catchbox](https://getcatchbox.com/) and [Aalto](http://www.aalto.fi/en/). 

I got a Msc. degree in Software engineering master's at <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/" target="_blank">Aalto University</a>
and a Bsc. degree in Network communication engineering from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/" target="_blank">Tecnico Lisboa</a> 

I also started  <a href="https://enginetaw.com" target="_blank">engine taw</a>
and <a href="http://northimpact.com" target="_blank">North Impact</a>. 
At North Impact we aim at solving the most challenging social problems 
through beautifully crafted software and hardware. Just because I love a
good challenge, that's why..

I was once a hockey player and did win some stuff: a couple of European 
leagues and was top2 in the World Championship in Chile. Now I put all 
my energies into climbing and coding (sometimes simultaneously). I'm 
also an avid traveller and I enjoy a good book!
