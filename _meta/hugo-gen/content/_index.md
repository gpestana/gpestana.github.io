# the world is eating software

I'm a software engineer at F-Secure currently working in the Rapid Detection 
Service backend team. On a daily basis, I play around with all things 
microservices, Go, docker, DCOS, Elasticsearch and security. Never 
without a warm mug of coffee by my side.

I got a Msc. degree in Software engineering master's at <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/" target="_blank">Aalto University</a>
and a Bsc. degree in Network communication engineering from <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/" target="_blank">Tecnico Lisboa</a> 

I've worked as a software consultant for over 3 years with  Go, Node.js, Python, 
data analysis, devops and web stuff. 
Along the way I've collaborated with some cool companies like 
<a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/" target="_blank">CERN</a>, 
<a href="http://fivestars.com" target="_blank">Fivestars</a>, 
<a href="http://getcatchbox.com" target="_blank">Catchbox</a> and Aalto.
 
I started  <a href="https://enginetaw.com" target="_blank">engine taw</a>. 
and <a href="http://northimpact.com" target="_blank">North Impact</a>. 
At North Impact we aim at solving the most challenging social problems 
through beautifully crafted software and hardware. Just because I love a
good challenge, that's why..

I was once a hockey player and did win some stuff: a couple of European 
leagues and was top2 in the World Championship in Chile. Now I put all 
my energies into climbing and coding (sometimes simultaneously). I'm 
also an avid traveller and I enjoy a good book!
