      <description>there is a moral imperative to leave the main social networks if they continue to operate as they do. while connecting people is a noble thing, exploiting them for money is unethical to say the least.
the dopamine shots carefully engineered to hook us up are ethically and morally wrong. those strategies do not improve user&amp;rsquo;s well being or satisfaction with the product. users come back because they become addicted to it.</description>
