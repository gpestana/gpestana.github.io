      <description>The goal of Coin Flipping Request Delegation (CFRD) is to add plausible deniability of routing and lookup requests in P2P networks, with special emphasis on DHT networks. The CFRD lookup protocol works by probabilistically creating a new lookup from a received routing request.
CFRD in Kademlia DHT In a Kademlia lookup request (as defined by these specs), the lookup initiator creates an ordered shortlist containing k peers closest to the ID of the contentID requested.</description>

      <title>Everyone is naked: Privacy in P2P networks</title>

      <description>The ethos of the P2P community and the decentralized web is based on a new paradigm where people and communities can interoperate and collaborate without the need for external stewardship. This new paradigm opens doors for user self-sovereignty, personal data ownership and freedom from central authorities which incentives tend to lock-in their users and to hold and monetize private data in order to maximize their profits. However, P2P and decentralized protocols are complex and collaboration between multiple parties often leaks metadata that can be used to target individuals and communities.</description>

      <description>One thing that is interesting about P2P and decentralised networks is that they tend to the &amp;ldquo;property extreme&amp;rdquo; (!lacking of a better name..). Consider, for example, scalability. P2P networks have better potential to scale compared to centralised (and distributed) client-server systems. That potential comes from the fact that network users can contribute with resources for the network to function, resulting on very interesting and self-sustained ecosystem in which scalability is elastic and self-regulated.</description>
