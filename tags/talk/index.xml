      <description>Note: this is a draft post
In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss one of the hardest challenges of decentralized web and P2P systems: privacy. Weâ€™ll focus on current systems and applications built or relying on P2P networks, focusing on the rather interesting tension between scalability, performance, discoverability (or collaboration, for short) and privacy of the network users. We will demonstrate how current systems are a threat for user privacy and briefly discuss how recent research has been trying to solve current open problems while taking into considerations the tradeoffs between privacy and usability.</description>
