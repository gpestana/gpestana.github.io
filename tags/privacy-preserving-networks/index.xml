      <description>One thing that is interesting about P2P and decentralised networks is that they tend to the &amp;ldquo;property extreme&amp;rdquo; (!lacking of a better name..). Consider, for example, scalability. P2P networks have better potential to scale compared to centralised (and distributed) client-server systems. That potential comes from the fact that network users can contribute with resources for the network to function, resulting on very interesting and self-sustained ecosystem in which scalability is elastic and self-regulated.</description>
