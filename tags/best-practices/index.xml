      <description>&amp;gt; This post is part of the series &amp;ldquo;The Zen of Data Pipelines&amp;rdquo; which explores how to build scalable and robust data systems. Most of the ideas and best practices described in this series were learned while implementing and maintaining a large scale data pipeline at F-Secure for the Rapid Detection Service.
