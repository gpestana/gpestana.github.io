      <title>the moral imperative to leave social networks</title>

      <description>there is a moral imperative to leave the main social networks if they continue to operate as they do. while connecting people is a noble thing, exploiting them for money is unethical to say the least.
the dopamine shots carefully engineered to hook us up are ethically and morally wrong. those strategies do not improve user&amp;rsquo;s well being or satisfaction with the product. users come back because they become addicted to it.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt; This post is part of the series &amp;ldquo;The Zen of Data Pipelines&amp;rdquo; which explores how to build scalable and robust data systems. Most of the ideas and best practices described in this series were learned while implementing and maintaining a large scale data pipeline at F-Secure for the Rapid Detection Service.

      <title>Managing credentials in production</title>

      <description>Every software must deal and manage credentials at some point. I will define credentials in the context of this article as secrets that must be protected at all costs, under risk of seriously compromising the security of production systems. There are several points to have in mind when managing credentials of productions systems:
Credentials storage should be kept secret by encryption and a strong access management. Credentials must never be transported but stored.</description>

      <title>kapacitor-unit: unit tests framework for TICKscripts</title>

      <description>This post discusses ideas for a proof of concept for a unit test framework for Kapacitor&amp;rsquo;s TICKscripts and alerts. If you are not familiar with Kapacitor and the TICK script I really suggest you to go ahead and check InfluxData&amp;rsquo;s website and learn more about it! In short, the TICK stack is a time series data platform that allows you to easily store, analyse and act on time series data at scale.</description>

      <title>Consensus manager for JS</title>

      <description>In one of my side-project - which uses socket.io - I need to reach a consensus amongst users in the same room. Initial requirements:
 The definition of &amp;lsquo;consensus&amp;rsquo; should be flexible and interchangeable in run-time; The time to reach the consensus should be tracked; The final consensus amongst the clients could possibly output some data that the server may need to use further on;  My solution consists of a modular entity which I pompously called consensus manager.</description>
