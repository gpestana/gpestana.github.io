        <h2> Coding mentoring.jam </h2>

        <h4>I've got some spare time to help you learn how to code!</h4>

          <p>Trying to learn how to code online can be pretty scary and overwhelming as there are tons of free and paid courses and articles and books and youtube videos asking for your attention. It is easy to get lost or stuck and without sense of direction. It is so much easier to have someone experienced and who has been through the same situation to guide you based on your goals, answer questions and even review your code or do pair programming!</p>

          <p>Whaat? <b>1:1</b> coding mentoring jams?! Sounds cool? Keep reading!</p>

            <div class="twelve columns"><p>We start of chatting about what are your goals, which languages or technologies you'd like to learn and so on. Do you have a project you'd like to do? Great, let's talk about it! The outcome of this session(s) is to come up with a loosely defined curriculum and a set of short and medium goals. The idea here is to define <b>where to go and how</b>, all based on your expectations, goals and time.</p></div>

It is possible to set up the whole plan only with free online courses and content and you'll also get tailored content prepared by me, if needed!</p></div>

            <div class="twelve columns"><p>As you go through the learning material and start working on your projects, we will regularly keep in touch and I will be available to answer your questions and review your code. Depending on your needs, we can set up online code reviews sessions, pair programming, and Q&A sessions. I will provide constant feedback and guidance throughout your way to become a programmer. </p></div>

        <span id="curriculum"></span>
        <h2>What can you learn?</h2>
        <p>That depends on what you are looking for! Frontend, backend development, web development, algorithms and computational theory or some specific language such as Python, Javascript and Node.js! Just bring your ideas and expectations and let's see where to go from there!</p>

  <span id="rates"></span>
  <h2>Rates</h2>
  <p>The rates are $25/hour for pair programming sessions, code review, feedback sessions and ad-hoc Q&A. The initial planning and set things up are free of charge.

  <p>I won't be accepting any money from you as I am doing this out of generosity and curiosity. I kindly ask you to donate the money to a cause that we both believe in!</p>
