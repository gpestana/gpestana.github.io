<p>One thing that is interesting about P2P and decentralised networks is that they
tend to the &ldquo;property extreme&rdquo; (!lacking of a better name..). Consider, for
example, scalability. P2P networks have better <em>potential</em> to scale compared to
centralised (and distributed) client-server systems. That <em>potential</em> comes from
the fact that network users can contribute with resources for the network to
function, resulting on very interesting and self-sustained ecosystem in which
scalability is elastic and self-regulated. The problem is how complex it is for
designers and developers to turn that <em>potential</em> into reality: P2P protocols and
networks are hard to design and to implement. It&rsquo;s hard to get all the pieces
right: from low level networking to peer interaction protocols, incentives
design, security, trust, privacy (and the list goes on..). Potential and
complexity are the forces behind the &ldquo;property extreme&rdquo; in P2P decentralised
systems: a system can potentially provide very good scalability but if it is
poorly designed and implemented scalability will end up being a bottleneck
instead of an edge.</p>

<p>Same goes for privacy. One of the most interesting propositions of P2P and
decentralised networks is its <em>potential</em> for respecting user&rsquo;s privacy by design.
Privacy by design becomes even more promising when compared to the current state
of affairs in which the services we use online are owned by companies with the
means and the incentives to register everything about their users. In P2P and
decentralised networks, there is no central entity which sieves through all what
happens in the network. However, P2P designs often require many to many
communication patterns and collaboration. Users in the network often work as
message relayers (one of the ways for everyone to contribute with resources to
the network) and need to make decisions based on their partial view of the state
of the network. With such constraints, network users (or peers) need to
collaborate and learn about each other&rsquo;s partial view of the network state. At a
higher level, these interactions often result on a lot of systemic leakage of
privacy-sensitive information: what a peers knows over time may disclose what
she&rsquo;s been up to. Or correlating the message patterns over time of a subset of
network peers may disclose what data they are consuming or serving. This
information leakage is even more important because it is disclosed not to one
entity as in centralised systems, but potentially to the whole network. Again,
the &ldquo;property extreme&rdquo; is at play: there is a lot of <em>potential</em> to design and
implement systems with the best privacy properties, but it will most likely be
leaking private data all over the place.</p>

<p>So there is a problem: it is hard to design and implement P2P and decentralised
networks and ensure the correct properties. For privacy preserving networks,
there is lack of primitives and implemented protocols that can be easily used
and adapted by developers. There is also a rather large chasm between academic
research on anonymous communications and privacy preserving networking and the
mechanisms and protocols implemented by current P2P projects. I argue that if we
want to design and build privacy preserving networks, we need as a community to
invest more time on:</p>

<ul>
<li>building modular and easy to use primitives and protocols for privacy preserving
P2P networks;</li>
<li>improve developer and system designer awareness about privacy enhancing
technologies;</li>
<li>close the gap between academia and industry: bring the of the art on research of
privacy preserving networks to the industry as soon as possible;</li>
<li>measure and assess privacy in current P2P networks and understand how to improve
it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Privacy preserving engineering</strong> is not a thing. Yet. We at hashmatter are working
on projects that enable developers and P2P system designers to build privacy
preserving networks. We&rsquo;re building p3lib, is a library with modular privacy
preserving primitives and protocols (p3) for routing and messaging in P2P
networks. We&rsquo;ve also started PPP, a list of primitives and protocols that can be
used in networked systems for improving privacy and anonymity. And we&rsquo;ve been
also researching on privacy preserving networks. We also believe that the
community could use more network security and privacy audits of P2P networks, so
we are also putting those efforts together.</p>
