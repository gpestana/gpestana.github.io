<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/cambridge-analytica-and-the-perils-of-psychographics">been</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpbeOCKZFfQ">interesting</a> <a href="https://github.com/SINTEF-9012/grindr-privacy-leaks">weeks</a> for those who have been thinking about online
privacy and data protection and what does it mean in today&rsquo;s hyper connected
society. Although this is a multi layered problem - personal data can be
collected at different network layers and in multiple ways- one of the most
effective ways to protect our personal data is to use the
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor network</a>.</p>

<p>When I tell friends and non so technical people that they should be
accessing the web through technologies that are used to access the
dark web, I&rsquo;m often received surprised reactions, fear, confusion and even
disgust. Although it is not hard to explain how Tor works and why is it used for
illicit purposes, it&rsquo;s been harder to explain why everyone should leverage Tor
on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the reason why you should use Tor is privacy, personal protection
and economics. Yes, the technology that powers part of the dark web can be used
for very good and legit purposes - as a matter of fact, the bulk of the traffic
going through Tor is exactly that. But surprise, surprise: just like any other
technology, it&rsquo;s all about how it is put into use. So let me lay out why I
believe using Tor is important for you and our society:</p>

<p>The first reason is that internet providers and governments have the tools and
the will to track online behavior of users and citizens, respectively.
This is a fact and it was demonstrated by the documents leaked by Snowden and
Manning about internet surveillance programs carried out by the US and EU intelligent
services. You may trust your government and thus not be concerned about the
fact that your government is able to collect all your online activity - and of
your families. Remember though, that the data is not only collected but also
stored, and with the current volatility in the world, are we able to ensure
that sensitive data about ourselves and our families will not be used against us
in the future by some sketchy people that got to govern us? We do not need nor
have to take that risk.</p>

<p>Another reason is essentially that our lives are more connected than ever. The
danger of having more devices in our home connected to the internet is that it
opens doors to surveillance and targeted attacks. Unfortunately there have been
cases of attackers being able to speak to a baby through babycam which is
connected to the internet.</p>

<p>Apart from those targeted attacks, the fact that we are more connected than even
gives companies and corporations the capabilities to
harvest more and more data about our private data. Where do we usually access
the internet? Which websites do we use the most? What are our interests? Which
services do we use? All this data can be easily harvested and ultimately put
together to make a accurate profile of who we are. This data can easily be used
for business purposes without our consent, discrimination and criminal purposes.</p>

<p>Technologies like Tor create a privacy layer which allows you to protect your
online privacy and sensitive data leaks.</p>

<p>The 3rd point I&rsquo;d like to make is economics. Using these technologies is
basically making illicit data harvesting hard. So hard that it becomes nonviable
to do so. It&rsquo;s all about economics: if we all make it hard for attackers and
companies to illegally gather people&rsquo;s data, then it becomes just too
expensive for them to do so. It becomes too expensive for companies like
Cambridge Analytica to profile people&rsquo;s based on their data
in order to change the course of democratic elections. Or it becomes really
expensive for rogue governments to spy on their citizens looking for
opportunities to silent opponents. Same goes for those who
are selling your data to the highest bidder.
If enough people turn their privacy shields on, this business model
will not be viable anymore.
So it becomes almost an ethically and moral imperative to protect your personal data.
Not only for yourself, but for a fairer and more secure online society.</p>

<p>If you are still not convinced and you still don&rsquo;t see a reason why you nor
anyone else should use technologies that hide user&rsquo;s online activity,
think about the journalists, whistle blowers, political dissidents, NGOs and
other citizens at risk that use Tor to communicate and share information safely,
without being traced by potential rogue governments or any malintended actors.
In those cases, it is life threatening to use the internet without the
privacy and security provided by Tor.</p>
